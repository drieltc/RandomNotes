# RandomNotes
 
Plain and simple: You tipe how the speed you want the program to show you the notes and hit the "Start" button. Right now it only shows notes on the Cmajor scale, but new scales will shortly be added. Hope you enjoy :)

P.S.
Currently working on a _Remake_. Still not working, figuring out the details of everything. Switch to 'react' branch, clone the repository and run locally to see how's it going :)
